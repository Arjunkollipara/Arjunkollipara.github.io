  <p>
    I'm a B.Tech CSE student at CMRCET with a passion for solving real-world problems through tech. From ESP modules and Arduino UNOs to Raspberry Pi setups, I love bringing hardware to life and turning ideas into working prototypes.
    <br>
    <br>
    I've built practical, impactful IoT-based projects like MonoScribe, Smart City, Eldify, and SPINE, combining sensors, embedded systems, and smart logic. My stack includes C/C++, Java, HTML/CSS, React, and MySQL — but more than the tech,I bring into every project: fast iterations, deep thinking, and solutions that just make sense.
    <br>
    <br>
    I'm currently diving deep into Cybersecurity, mastering DSA, and building my startup journey from scratch — because I don’t just want to code, I want to build things that actually matter.

  <p>
    A practical problem solver with a deep passion for building real-world, impactful solutions.
    My journey began with a simple idea — technology should be inclusive, accessible, and solve actual problems.
    That idea led me to develop projects like MonoScribe, a smart communication device for the deaf, and contribute to larger visions like Smart City systems.
    These weren’t just academic exercises — they were born from real needs, and every step fueled my belief in innovation with purpose.
    <br><br>
    I’m now actively building a startup, channeling my experience into creating affordable tech that makes a difference.
    Whether it's IoT, embedded systems, or AI-driven automation, I approach every project with a mix of curiosity, technical skill, and relentless drive.
    <br><br>
    My interests have grown beyond building — I'm diving into the world of cybersecurity and preparing for GATE, pushing my limits daily to become a well-rounded engineer, entrepreneur, and innovator.
    I believe in learning by doing, solving problems hands-on, and turning every challenge into a launchpad for something greater.
